## 🧠 Focus

I work on understanding **machine learning from first principles**, with particular emphasis on the mathematics that drives model behavior.

- Linear algebra and probability for machine learning  
- Classical machine learning algorithms  
- Optimization and model understanding  
- Data analysis on real-world datasets  

---

## 🔬 What I'm Working On

- Building a strong mathematical foundation for machine learning  
- Translating theory into clean, correct Python implementations  
- Developing Kaggle notebooks and GitHub projects with a focus on clarity and correctness  

📌 **Primary work:**  
Mathematics-focused ML notes and implementations (see pinned repositories)

## 🧭 Methodology

My approach prioritizes **understanding before implementation**.

Each project typically follows:
- Mathematical formulation  
- Clear assumptions  
- Simple, readable code  
- Evaluation and limitations  

> *Good models come from understanding the problem, not just using the tools.*

## 📂 Projects

My repositories focus on:
- Mathematical foundations of machine learning  
- Classical ML algorithms implemented from scratch  
- Exploratory analysis of structured datasets  
- Conceptual writeups connecting theory with practice
