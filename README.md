## Methodology

My approach emphasizes theoretical understanding before implementation.  
Each project begins with mathematical formulation, followed by clean implementation and critical evaluation.

> *Understanding precedes optimization.*
---

## 📂 Projects

- Mathematical foundations of machine learning (code-focused notebooks)  
- Exploratory analysis of structured datasets  
- Classical algorithms implemented from first principles  
- Conceptual writeups connecting theory with practice  

Projects are added progressively as they reach a publishable standard.
