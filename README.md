👋 Hi, I’m Sami Ullah

🎓 Undergrad CS Student
📍 Building a Research level profile in Ai/ML
🧠 Focus: Math → Code → Intuition

🚀 About Me

I am a computer science student building a strong foundation in machine learning by connecting mathematical theory with practical implementation.

Instead of using models as black boxes, I focus on:

understanding how algorithms work mathematically

translating linear algebra & probability into Python code

applying concepts on real-world datasets

I use Kaggle notebooks and GitHub to document my learning journey.

🎯 Current Focus

Linear Algebra for Machine Learning

Probability & Statistics (intuition-first)

Classical ML algorithms (from scratch where possible)

Data analysis using real datasets

🛠️ Tech Stack (Growing)

Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

ML: scikit-learn (foundations)

Tools: Jupyter / Kaggle Notebooks, GitHub

(Deep Learning tools coming later — fundamentals first.)

📘 Learning Philosophy

“Understand the math → implement it → explain it simply.”

My goal is not speed, but clarity and depth.
Each project is designed to strengthen intuition, not just accuracy.

📂 Projects (Work in Progress)

🚧 This section will grow as I learn and publish:

ML Math → Code Notebooks

Dataset Explorations (Kaggle)

Algorithms from Scratch

Conceptual Writeups (Math + ML)

👉 Check back soon for updates.

🌱 What I’m Working Toward

Strong ML foundations suitable for research-oriented programs

Public, well-explained notebooks and projects

A profile aligned with competitive scholarships & graduate studies
